📖Full description of all [**my projects**](https://cryham.org/projects/) 🎨.  

I moved all **my own projects to [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/cryham?tab=repositories)**, because of [these reasons](https://drewdevault.com/2022/03/29/free-software-free-infrastructure.html), and I recommend it.  
On github I only left my **forks** (of other github repos).  
Of course I don't want anyone to upload my projects to github, [website with info](https://nogithub.codeberg.page/).
